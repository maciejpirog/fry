Fry, a declarative object-oriented programming language

Fry is an experimental language that combines the best features of object-oriented (anybody?) and declarative paradigms. The slogans are: "**panobjectivity**" - everything is an object - which gives you the lightweightness feeling of Smalltalk (and their descendants such as Ruby), and "**less is more**" - no mutable data structures! - which gives you the true declarative lightweightness of pure functional programming (as in Haskell).

The theoretical foundation of Fry is Mart√≠n Abadi and Luca Cardelli's calculus of primitive objects augmented with base types, side-effects, and inheritance. Fry comes equipped with a full formal operational semantics.

Note that Fry is in its infancy. A lot of changes to the language and surroundings are bound to happen, some of them revolutionary, all of them unpredictable.
